# neo4j_setup

With existing DB folders, you can create a folder named "data" in the root folder, and put your ``xxx.db`` folders in ``./data``, and replace the ``graph.db`` to your ``xxx.db``, and directly run ``docker-compose build & docker-compose up`` to run the neo4j, and you can access ``localhost:7474`` to visit the neo4j UI in your broswer.
